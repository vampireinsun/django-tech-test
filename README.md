## Overview

Growth Street is building a platform to allow growing businesses to borrow money at affordable rates. Our ability to make the entire process efficient on our web platform will be critical in offering the lowest rates to our customers. 

#### The Task

Build a Django app for borrowers to register and request a loan. You will need to collect the following information:

* The borrower's name, email, and telephone number.
* The borrower's business' name, address, registered company number (8 digit number), and business sector (pick from Retail, Professional Services, Food & Drink, or Entertainment).
* The amount the borrower wishes to borrow in GBP (between £10000 and £100000), for how long (number of days), and a reason for the loan (text description).
* This information should be stored in the database via appropriate models, and accessible to an admin in the standard Django Admin tool.

#### Notes

You are encouraged to use 3rd party libraries and the built-in framework tools when it makes sense (for example "django-registration-redux" or "django-allauth" to help handle registering a new user)
While the final product should have an interface via a web browser, there is no need for styles or anything beyond functional HTML
